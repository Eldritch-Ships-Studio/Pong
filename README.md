# Pong
Remake of the classic Pong in Godot 4. Use your paddle to knock the ball back at your opponent to score.
## Controls
Your paddle moves up and down with W&S or⬆️&⬇️.
## To Do
This release is a rough proof of concept. I'd like to implement options to vary the opposing paddle's speed and alter the background designs. I'd like to implement a game end condition.
Future releases should include linux, web, and mobile platforms and gamepad support.
